    <h3>How to make Lasagna step-by-step:</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
            <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving. </li>
        </ol>

    <h3>How to layer the Lasagna:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to cook the Lasagna</h3>
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. 
        Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it. </p>
    
    <h3>How to reheat Lasagna:</h3>
        <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly. </p>

    <h3>How to freeze Lasagna</h3>
        <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months. </p>

    <h3>How to reheat frozen Lasagna</h3>
        <p>Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>    

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <b><p>Step 1:</p></b>
    <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. </p>

    <b><p>Step 2:</p></b>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </p>

    <b><p>Step 3:</p></b>
    <p> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </p>

    <b><p>Step 4:</p></b>
    <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </p>

    <b><p>Step 5:</p></b>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </p>
